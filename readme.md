# FCOS_POSE

Codes for my paper **"STUDENT DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR DETECTION IN SCHOOL"**. Currently, we have only tested the effectiveness of our method on the personal collected danger behavior dataset. You can build a similar dataset by yourself, and transfer our `FCOS_POSE` framework based on FCOS (object detection) and auxiliary keypoints (pose estimation) to your human behavior detection task.

## Installition

**Note:** Our `FCOS_POSE` is mostly based on the original [FCOS](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS). You can follow it to set the environment.

**Environment:** Anaconda, Python3.8, PyTorch1.10.0(CUDA11.2), wandb
