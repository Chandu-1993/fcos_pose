# FCOS_POSE

Codes for my paper **"STUDENT DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR DETECTION IN SCHOOL"**. Currently, we have only tested the effectiveness of our method on the personal collected danger behavior dataset. You can build a similar dataset by yourself, and transfer our `FCOS_POSE` framework based on FCOS (object detection) and auxiliary keypoints (pose estimation) to your human behavior detection task.
